  <p>Hello <%= @resource.name || @resource.email %>!</p>

  <p>Your team captain has invited you to use <%= link_to "AlfiesTeam", root_url %>, a reminder program for adult sports leagues. You can accept it through the link below.</p>

  <p><%= link_to 'Accept Invitation', accept_invitation_url(@resource, :invitation_token => @resource.invitation_token) %></p>

  <p>AlfiesTeam allows your team captain to set up email and text reminders of upcoming game times. You'll receive an email the day before and a text message a few hours before your games. From either the email or the text you can easily RSVP so your captain will know whether you'll be at the game or not.</p>

  <p>If you don't want to accept the invitation, please ignore this email.<br />
  Your account won't be created until you access the link above and set your password.</p>
